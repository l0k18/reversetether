# reversetether

automatic installation for gnirehtet on linux

Installs adb, pushes the apk to your android device, copies the binary to /usr/local/bin and installs the desktop item in /usr/share/applications so it can be added to autorun for gnome via gnome tweak tool.

## What's this all about?

I believe that all animals, including us, were evolved in a specific radio environment and minimising radio waves in one's surroundings is beneficial to health. The solar and atmospheric radio signals that naturally occur in cycles are part of a clock that our bodies needs to synchronise its activities. As a Go programmer, I know very well the results of desynchronisation so I don't think it is healthy to impede our body's clocks any more than absolutely necessary, or, when it's imposed upon us by circumstances. If one machine is on the network, why have two radios competing for signal and bandwidth, when it can be piped through one.

It is possible to connect a mobile device to ethernet but this precludes charging at the same time. Reverse tethering is just the best solution. The only downside is how to wrestle android to grant root access. If anyone is interested I can give some tips on working with the nice and durable 2021 Motorola Defy xt2038-9 european version.

All of the "noroot" options DON'T WORK. You must have root to get internet on your device without resorting to a radio connection.
