## What's this all about?

I believe that all animals, including us, were evolved in a specific radio environment and minimising radio waves in one's surroundings is beneficial to health. The solar and atmospheric radio signals that naturally occur in cycles are part of a clock that our bodies needs to synchronise its activities. As a Go programmer, I know very well the results of desynchronisation so I don't think it is healthy to impede our body's clocks any more than absolutely necessary, or, when it's imposed upon us by circumstances. If one machine is on the network, why have two radios competing for signal and bandwidth, when it can be piped through one.
